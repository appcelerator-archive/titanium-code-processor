The ```CodeProcessor``` module is the entry point for the Titanium Code Processor library. For examples on how to use it, 
check out the ```codeprocessor``` bin script that ships with the code processor. 

If you are interested in developing a plugin, checkout the ```Runtime``` module and the plugins that ship with the code 
processor. Note that a solid understanding of JavaScript and a familiarity with the ECMAScript spec are necessary for
creating plugins.
