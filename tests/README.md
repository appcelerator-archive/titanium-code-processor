ti-code-processor-tests
=======================

This plugin includes unit tests for the code processor


To run the unit tests, you will first need to grab the ecma test262 framework.  
The test262 framework can be downloaded at http://hg.ecmascript.org/tests/test262/  
Once you have downloaded it, unzip to the third-party directory and rename the root directory to 'test262'.  
After the test framework has been downloaded and unzipped, run 'bin/codeProcessorTest' from the root directory.
